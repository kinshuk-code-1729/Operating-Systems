- *An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.*
- *For the most part, the IT industry largely focuses on the top five OSs, including Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, Google's Android OS, Linux Operating System, and Apple iOS.*
- *The communication between a user and a system takes place with the help of an operating systems. Windows, Linux, and Android are examples of operating systems that enable the user to use programs like MS Office, Notepad, and games on the computer or mobile phone*

## CPU Scheduling
**_CPU scheduling_** in OS is a method by which one process is allowed to use the CPU while the other processes are kept on hold or are kept in the waiting state. This hold or waiting state is implemented due to the unavailability of any of the system resources like I/O etc.

### Important Terms Related to CPU Scheduling in OS
- **Arrival time in OS:** It is the time of arrival of a process in the ready queue.
- **Completion Time in OS:** It is the time at which the selected process completes its execution.
- **Burst Time in OS:** This is the time required by a process for its execution by the CPU.
- **Turn Around Time in OS:** Turnaround time for each process is the difference in completion time and the time of arrival of that process. 

**_[ Turn around time = Completion time ‚Äì Arrival time ]_**
- **Waiting time in OS:** The waiting time for each and every process is the difference between the turnaround time and burst time of that process.

**_[ Waiting time = Turnaround time ‚Äì Burst time ]._**
